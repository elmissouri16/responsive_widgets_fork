/// A box with a specified size.
///
/// If given a child, this widget forces its child to have a specific width
/// and/or height (assuming values are permitted by this widget's parent). If
/// either the width or height is null, this widget will size itself to match
/// the child's size in that dimension.
///
/// If not given a child, [SizedBox] will try to size itself as close to the
/// specified height and width as possible given the parent's constraints. If
/// [height] or [width] is null or unspecified, it will be treated as zero.
///
/// The [new SizedBox.expand] constructor can be used to make a [SizedBox] that
/// sizes itself to fit the parent. It is equivalent to setting [width] and
/// [height] to [double.infinity].

/// This snippet makes the child widget (a [Card] with some [Text]) have the
/// exact size 200x300, parental constraints permitting:
///
/// ```dart
/// SizedBox(
///   width: 200.0,
///   height: 300.0,
///   child: const Card(child: Text('Hello World!')),
/// )
/// ```

///  * [ConstrainedBox], a more generic version of this class that takes
///    arbitrary [BoxConstraints] instead of an explicit width and height.
///  * [UnconstrainedBox], a container that tries to let its child draw without
///    constraints.
///  * [FractionallySizedBox], a widget that sizes its child to a fraction of
///    the total available space.
///  * [AspectRatio], a widget that attempts to fit within the parent's
///    constraints while also sizing its child to match a given aspect ratio.
///  * [FittedBox], which sizes and positions its child widget to fit the parent
///    according to a given [BoxFit] discipline.
